# Umi

This is a simple ERC-721 minting contract that allows me to manually mint an on-chain SVG to for my neice Umi on her birthday.

Each SVG contains a piece of wisdom plucked from a [list](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/) of unsolicited advice shared by my dad. I think of this contract as a long-term gifting medium, allowing our family's knowledge and learnings to pass onto the next generation.
